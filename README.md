### **Week 1 Summary:**
In Week 1, I learned Python basics including variables, data types, operators, input/output, conditional statements, and loops. I practiced by creating a temperature converter and a calculator. I also built a small data processing project to calculate average temperature. This week helped me understand Python syntax and logical thinking.
     


### **Week 2 Summary:**
In Week 2, I learned Python data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. I understood how functions, lambda expressions, recursion, and list comprehension help in writing efficient code. I practiced transforming and filtering data using functions and completed a data-cleaning script to remove duplicates and filter values. This week improved my logical thinking and data handling skills in Python.
