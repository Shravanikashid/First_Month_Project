### **Week 1 Summary:**
In Week 1, I learned Python basics including variables, data types, operators, input/output, conditional statements, and loops. I practiced by creating a temperature converter and a calculator. I also built a small data processing project to calculate average temperature. This week helped me understand Python syntax and logical thinking.
